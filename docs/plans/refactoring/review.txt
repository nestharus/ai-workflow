Validation of FastAPI Best Practice Plan
Documents
General Observations (All Plan Documents)
Repeated Introductory Content: Each plan file begins with the same Observations, Gaps
Identified, and Approach/Reasoning sections. These were useful for planning but should be
omitted from the final documentation to avoid duplication. In the final docs, start with the actual
pattern content (the “Proposed File Change” sections).
Excessive File References: Many plans reference specific files and even line numbers in the
codebase as examples. This is problematic because code lines can change. It’s better to inline selfcontained code examples or pseudocode demonstrating patterns, or reference a class/concept by
name rather than by file line. For instance, instead of “see app/core/factory.py lines 39–44,”
include a small code snippet showing the startup event usage. Only keep file references when
instructing the reader to use a specific existing component (e.g. “use the AppError model from
errors.py ”), not for illustrating a pattern. This will make the documentation stable and easier to
follow.
